Zabbix-Read-Only-Filesystem-Check
=================================

# Author: Joshua Cagle
# Organization: The University of Oregon

# This script checks for filesystems that are read only. This will
# be used in conjuction with the Zabbix monitoring and alerting system.
# If the script returns 0 then the filesystem in read only mode.
# This script uses a non-exhaustive case statment of potential mount paths,
# yet they are common in our environment.

# In order to use this a Zabbix configuration fragment will have to be made.
# It should look like this:
# UserParameter=checkro[*],/etc/zabbix/scripts/checkro.sh $1
